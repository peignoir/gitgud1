Research the following founder and determine if they are famous or have notable achievements:

${name ? `Name: ${name}` : ''}
${email ? `Email: ${email}` : ''}
${linkedinUrl ? `LinkedIn: ${linkedinUrl}` : ''}
${bio ? `Bio:\n${bio}` : ''}

A founder is considered "famous" if they:
1. Founded/co-founded a company that raised $10M+ in funding
2. Had a successful exit (acquisition or IPO)
3. Are well-known in their industry (frequent speaker, thought leader, large following)
4. Have significant media coverage or awards
5. Previously worked at a famous startup in a senior role (not just any employee)
6. Have a strong reputation in the startup ecosystem

IMPORTANT:
- Being an early employee at a big company does NOT make them famous (e.g., "worked at Google" is not enough)
- Having a LinkedIn or Twitter does NOT make them famous
- Normal startup experience is NOT enough
- Be STRICT - only mark as famous if they have truly notable achievements

Based on the information provided, evaluate if this founder is famous.
