**Date:** Sept 30, 2025  
**Status:** Complete and ready to test

---

## What You Asked For

> "make the gitgud.vc brand more visible and make it like Guddy is real and talking to you, start by introducing herself and she's there at every step, eg capguddy is reading your life achievement, keep it positive pro but funny Silicon valley low key type, GenZ friendly"

---

## ✅ All Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed Mem0 API Error** 
**Problem:** Mem0 was throwing "At least one of the filters: agent_id, user_id, app_id, run_id is required!"

**Solution:**
- Changed filter format from `{ filters: { user_id } }` to `{ user_id }` (top-level parameter)
- Updated `searchMemory()` and `addMemory()` functions
- Now gracefully degrades if Mem0 fails (doesn't break the app)

📁 Fixed in: `mobile-app/src/lib/utils/mem0-client.ts`

### 2. **Guddy Introduces Herself in Challenge**
**Before:**
```
"Hey! 👋 I'm your Vibe Code Coach..."
```

**After:**
```
"Hey! 👋 I'm Guddy from GitGud.vc. I just read through your achievements 
and honestly... [references specific things from bio]

Dude, you've built 10+ companies. Maybe you're a bit rusty but we both know 
you can ship. I'm here to help you git gud."
```

**Changes:**
- Guddy introduces herself by name
- References founder's bio specifically ("you've built X companies")
- Silicon Valley low-key tone, GenZ friendly
- Always mentions GitGud.vc
- Provides tool links (Lovable, Cursor, Bolt, etc.) with URLs

📁 Updated: `mobile-app/src/app/api/founder-journey/stream/route.ts` (challenge prompt)

---

### 3. **Tool Links Now Provided Automatically**

### 5. **Session Persistence - Resume Your Challenge**

**Problem:** If you log out during challenge, you start from scratch when you log back in.

**Solution:**
- Challenge state saved to `localStorage` automatically
- Saves: time remaining, messages, video URL, 5-liner, code URL
- Loads on mount - you resume exactly where you left off
- Cleared when challenge is completed

**Try it:**
1. Start challenge
2. Chat with Guddy
3. Refresh page or log out/in
4. Challenge resumes with same time left + chat history ✅

📁 Updated: `mobile-app/src/components/journey/ChallengePhase.tsx`

---

### 6. **Personality Consistency**

**Guddy's vibe across all interactions:**
- **Real**: "I'm Guddy from GitGud.vc"
- **Personal**: References your actual bio and achievements
- **Silicon Valley low-key**: "Dude, you've shipped 10+ companies"
- **GenZ friendly**: "Let's ship something! 💪"
- **Positive but real**: "Maybe you're rusty but we both know you can ship"
- **Helpful**: Provides links, examples, guidance
- **Pattern recognition**: "You tend to overthink the MVP - just ship it"
