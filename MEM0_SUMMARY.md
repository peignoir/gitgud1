# Mem0 Integration - DONE ‚úÖ

**Date:** Sept 30, 2025  
**Status:** Fully integrated and ready to test

---

## What You Asked For

> "yes please" - integrate Mem0 for Guddy's long-term memory

---

## What I Did

### 1. **Installed Mem0**
```bash
npm install mem0ai  # In mobile-app directory
```

### 2. **Created Mem0 Client** (`mobile-app/src/lib/utils/mem0-client.ts`)
- `addMemory()` - Store conversations
- `searchMemory()` - Find relevant memories
- `getMemoryContext()` - Build AI-ready context
- Full TypeScript types and error handling

### 3. **Integrated with API** (`mobile-app/src/app/api/founder-journey/stream/route.ts`)

**Before AI generates response:**
```typescript
// Retrieve relevant memories
const memoryContext = await getMemoryContext(
  `Phase: ${phase}. User context.`,
  session.user.email
);

// Inject into prompt
const prompt = buildPromptForPhase(phase, data, memoryContext);
```

**After AI completes:**
```typescript
// Store interaction for next time
await addMemory([
  { role: 'user', content: userMessage },
  { role: 'assistant', content: aiResponse }
], session.user.email);
```

### 4. **User Scoping**
- Each user's memories are isolated by `session.user.email`
- No cross-contamination between users

### 5. **Documentation**
- `MEM0_INTEGRATION.md` - Full integration guide
- `lib/utils/README.md` - Utility docs
- `SIMPLIFIED.md` - Updated with Mem0 status

## How It Works Now

### **Scenario: Founder comes back 3 weeks later**

**Week 1 - Bio Generation:**
```
Founder: "Generate my bio"
Guddy: Creates bio, lists all ventures
Mem0: Stores bio + conversation
```

**Week 3 - Challenge Coaching:**
```
Founder: "I'm stuck on MVP scope"
Guddy retrieves memories...
  ‚Üí Sees: "Founder is experienced (10+ ventures)"
  ‚Üí Sees: "Tends to overthink based on bio depth"
Guddy: "You've built 10+ products. Trust your gut. 
           Keep this MVP stupid simple - one core feature."
```

**Week 5 - Sprint Check-in:**
```
Founder: "Should I pivot?"
Guddy retrieves memories...
  ‚Üí Sees: Challenge from Week 3
  ‚Üí Sees: Original bio and archetype
Guddy: "You mentioned MVP scope struggles last time. 
           Is this pivot necessary, or are you overthinking again?"
```

## Test It

### **1. Start the app:**
```bash
npm run app
```

### **2. Go through journey as a logged-in user**

### **3. Check terminal logs:**
```bash
‚úÖ [Mem0] Stored 2 messages for user test@email.com
üîç [Mem0] Found 3 memories for query: "Phase: profile..."
```

### **4. Come back later (log out, log in)**
Guddy should reference past interactions!

## Environment Check

‚úÖ `MEM0_API_KEY` already in `.env.local`:
```
MEM0_API_KEY=m0-WKzLAFyHay5WJQ2teJdjMRJjvxm7YBZuO0qnXUqU
```

## What Guddy Can Do Now

### **Pattern Recognition**
"You always ship faster when you limit scope"

### **Progress Tracking**
"3 weeks ago you struggled with X. Look at you now!"

### **Personalized Advice**
"Based on your 10+ ventures, you know this. Trust yourself."

### **Context Continuity**
"Last time you mentioned marketing was a challenge..."

### **Long-Term Support**
"I've seen you work through 3 sprints. This is normal for you."

## Files Changed/Added

**Added:**
- ‚úÖ `mobile-app/src/lib/utils/mem0-client.ts` - Mem0 utilities
- ‚úÖ `mobile-app/MEM0_INTEGRATION.md` - Full docs
- ‚úÖ `mobile-app/src/lib/utils/README.md` - Utils reference
- ‚úÖ `MEM0_SUMMARY.md` - This file

**Modified:**
- ‚úÖ `mobile-app/src/app/api/founder-journey/stream/route.ts` - Integrated Mem0
- ‚úÖ `mobile-app/package.json` - Added mem0ai dependency
- ‚úÖ `SIMPLIFIED.md` - Updated memory stack section

## Error Handling

**Graceful degradation:**
- If Mem0 fails, app continues without long-term context
- LibSQL (working memory) still works
- Logs warnings but doesn't break user flow

---

## Next Steps (Optional)

### **Immediate: Test it!**
1. Run the app
2. Generate bio
3. Go through challenge
4. Log out and back in
5. Guddy should remember you!

### **Future Enhancements:**
1. Memory management UI - show founders what Guddy remembers
2. Memory analytics - "You ship 3x faster when..."
3. Semantic search - "What did Guddy say about marketing?"
